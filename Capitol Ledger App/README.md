# CapitolWonk CE App

CapitolWonk CE is the mobile-first civic intelligence MVP we are building around a premium dark navy, gold, and glassmorphism design system.

## Current Workspace

Source app: this local workspace folder.

Clean local preview:

`http://127.0.0.1:3020`

## Preview Restart

The preview is running in production mode, so after changes:

1. Stop the Terminal preview with `Control+C`.
2. Rerun the same start command from the project folder.
3. Refresh the browser page.

## Core Direction

CapitolWonk CE should feel like Bloomberg Terminal meets Apple meets modern civic accountability:

- Deep navy mobile interface
- Gold and amber civic-tech highlights
- Glassmorphism cards
- Capitol-inspired circular motifs
- Premium SaaS subscription polish
- Legislative intelligence, accountability, and engagement tools

## Product Notes

- Current focus: first trusted beta tester intake on June 6, 2026. Phase 1 is tester-launch ready; Phase 2 and Phase 3 are now in beta QA/triage mode.
- Latest pushed beta package: `b5106dd Prepare beta tester polish and guide`.
- The first-round beta tester guide lives in `docs/beta-tester-guide` as Markdown, PDF, editable DOCX, and annotated snapshots.
- Password reset/forgot-password has been verified working for the beta pass.
- Free, Pro Intelligence, and Civic Team now share one subscription entitlement matrix, with demo mode switchers on `/account` and `/upgrade`.
- Subscription modes now visibly affect the app: dashboard Pro policy lens, bill detail AI/source/video gates, search smart filters and export reports, alerts priority lane, and Civic Team map/workspace panel.
- The subscription walkthrough, expected plan behavior, and QA checklist live in `Subscription Demo Guide.md`.
- Gamification now has account-backed persistence through `/api/account/gamification`, with demo fallback storage and a Prisma-ready account gamification model.
- `/impact`, `/badges`, and the profile stats now share one gamification data source for civic score, streak, badges, achievements, and impact actions.
- Gamification rules now define points, streak credit, dedupe behavior, impact metric mapping, and badge thresholds for the core civic actions.
- `/alerts` now behaves like an action-first inbox with `All`, `Action Needed`, and `Unread` filters.
- Opening a notification marks it as read in demo browser storage, removes the unread dot, and removes the item from the `Unread` filter.
- `/account` now includes optional party affiliation, displayed under city/district and controlled from Account Settings.
- Save/unsave star actions on official and bill profiles now provide immediate in-UI confirmation (`Saved to your ledger` / `Removed from your ledger`) while updating saved-ledger state.
- Official profile accountability now uses a visible nonpartisan methodology: the score is a weighted source-coverage model across voting records, public engagement, sponsored bills, and ethics/compliance evidence.
- Active next step: run the deployed `/beta` smoke path, send the beta guide and deployed `/beta` link to the first trusted testers, then triage `/feedback/review` after each session.
